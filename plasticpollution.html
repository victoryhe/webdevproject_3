      <h1>The Problem of Plastic Pollution</h1>
      <h2>What is Plastic Pollution?</h2>
      <p>Plastic pollution is the accumulation of plastic objects in the Earth's environment that adversely affects wildlife, habitat, and human health. Plastics are non-biodegradable and can persist in the environment for hundreds of years.</p>

      <h2>Sources of Plastic Pollution</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Single-use plastics (bags, bottles, straws)
          <p>Single-use plastics are disposable items that are used once and discarded, such as plastic bags, water bottles, and straws. These plastics contribute significantly to land and marine pollution, often breaking down into smaller pieces called microplastics, which are difficult to clean up and harmful to wildlife. Globally, billions of plastic bags and bottles are produced each year, and less than 10% are recycled, leading to massive waste accumulation in landfills and oceans.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Microplastics from cosmetics and clothing fibers
          <p>Microplastics are tiny plastic particles that are less than 5mm in size. They are found in many personal care products such as exfoliating scrubs, toothpaste, and even some shampoos. Additionally, synthetic fibers from clothing, such as polyester, shed microplastics during washing. These tiny particles bypass filtration systems in wastewater treatment plants, eventually making their way into rivers, oceans, and drinking water sources, where they can be ingested by marine life and humans.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Industrial waste and discarded fishing gear
          <p>Industrial waste includes large amounts of plastic materials used in packaging and manufacturing processes. Many of these plastic materials are not disposed of properly, leading to environmental contamination. Discarded fishing gear, such as nets, lines, and traps, also represents a significant source of plastic pollution in oceans. Known as "ghost gear," this lost or abandoned equipment continues to entangle and harm marine animals, contributing to the death of thousands of species each year.</p>

      <h2>Impact on Marine Life</h2>
      <p>Plastic pollution has devastating effects on marine life. Animals like turtles, birds, and fish often mistake plastic debris for food, leading to ingestion and entanglement, which can cause injury or death.</p>
